    "* don't rush to code, articulate what we want to do with our code in common language before diving into syntax\n",
    "* Break down the code in logical chunks that can be tested individually\n",
    "* Annotate the code well\n",
    "* think about how to streamline our code (examples: write functions, in line code, for/while loops, chaining)\n",
    "* So, on these activities, I will brainstorm the major steps of my code and include that in the activities we work on in class. "

Then we created traces to make a line plot showing the closing prices of the stock over time. This activity allows us to use d3.json, which will create a \"promise\" to fetch data. We chained .then() with a function to specific whihc data to store once it was fetched.\n",

Should be able to handle subsequent entries from the user. I'm still getting an error in my console (I think on console.log of the data), but the graph is working, so I'm calling it a victory for now.\n",
